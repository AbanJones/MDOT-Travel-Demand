## How to get started
+ Get a Google Maps API key https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key 
+ `clone` the repository, `cd` into the populartimes directory and run `pip install .`
+ Alternatively install directly from github using `pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/m-wrzr/populartimes`
+ `import populartimes` and run with `populartimes.get(...)` or `populartimes.get_id(...)`
 + **Note**: The library is not available via PyPI, so you have to clone/download the repository and install it locally.
